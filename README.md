# Card-Game-Minimax
A program that plays a simple two-player card game using Minimax algorithm. Below are the rules for the game:
1. There are thirty (30) cards in the deck. The cards are the 2 though Jack of the suits Clubs, Diamonds, and Hearts. 
2. The players are each dealt, face down, a hand of seven (7) cards, the deal alternating between the players. 
3. The fifteen card is dealt face-up. This card is the trump card. The suit of the trump card is called the trump suit. The trump card is not used further in the game. 
4. Each player picks up his or her own hand. That is, a player can see his or her own hand and the trump card, but not the other player's hand. 
5. The first player plays any card from his or her hand, placing it face up on the table. 
6. The second player plays a card from his or her hand, but not any card. The second player may play any card whose suit is of the trump suit or may play a card of the same suit as that of the first player's card, if possible (this is called "following suit."). If the second player has no such card, the second player may play any card in his or her hand. The card is placed face up on the table. 
7. If two cards played are of the same suit, the card with the higher face value wins. Otherwise, if one of the cards is of the trump suit, that card wins. Otherwise, the first player's card wins (as the second player could not follow suit.). The player with the winning card takes both cards from the table (the trick). These cards are now out of the game. 
8. Play continues (with the same player going first each time) until all the cards have been played. 
9. The player who takes the most number of tricks wins the hand.
